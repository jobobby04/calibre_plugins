## Credit
Thank you to Kiwidude for the awesome plugin repository and build system. I know nothing of Calibre plugins or Python and finding their [plugin repo](https://github.com/kiwidude68/calibre_plugins)
was the only reason I got this far.

Due to copying their code, I have copied the license over as well, no changes have been made on that front.
